Life's back to the drawing board
Disorganized thoughts about life
Let's start by plotting your entire life
Correlation doesn't mean causation
F*ck procrastination
Existential third degree plotting
First degree sarcastic prejudices
I think rationality is relative
Graphs might crystallize thoughts
Chart it until it makes sense
