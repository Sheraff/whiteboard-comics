Life's back to the drawing board
Disorganized thoughts about life
Let's start by plotting your entire life
Correlation doesn't mean causation
F*ck procrastination
Existential third degree plotting
First degree sarcastic prejudices
Graphs might crystallize thoughts
Chart it until it makes sense
A plotted life is a happy life
Data driven dark humor
If no data was collected, did it happen?
No such thing as uncorrelated variables
